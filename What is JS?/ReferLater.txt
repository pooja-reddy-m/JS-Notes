Why does it do Nodejs does js execution synchronously? will chorme v8 does the same?
However, Node.js can handle asynchronous operations using:
Callbacks
Promises
Async/Await
Event Loop (Non-blocking I/O) ??
v8 does?
Web APIs (e.g., setTimeout, fetch)
Event Loop (manages async tasks)
Callback Queue (executes deferred functions)

Even when handling multiple tasks (like fetching data or reading files), JavaScript
 doesnâ€™t create new threads but instead delegates work to asynchronous handlers 
 (like Web APIs in the browser or libuv in Node.js).
